### 5. WMS Stitched Capabilities
**Theme:** Web Map Service stitched capabilities architecture.
- In-memory, scalable system for dynamic routing.
- User client connects through reverse proxy to combined capabilities from GFS, Radar, Satellite, and Lightning services.
- Each service has specific TTL values (2 minutes to 30 seconds).
- Enables routing GTile traffic to correct WMS pods.

### 6. How Do We Manage?
**Theme:** Scope of infrastructure management.
- Dozens of models, hundreds of WMS layers (469), hundreds of WMS styles (1-8 per layer).
- Products/Spectras, Mesoscale Models, Radar sites (mosaics and single site).
- Satellites (full disk and rapid scan), Map layer products, and static products.

### 7. Templating!
**Theme:** Templating solution for managing complex infrastructure.
- Templating Engine: Python scripts using Jinja templating.
- Templating Configuration: YAML files, iwebservice stubs, and map files.
- Demonstrates weather map interface and configuration code generation.

---

### 8. What This Enables
**Theme:** Benefits of the templating approach.
- Easy Model Switching: Frontend users define 'product' and toggle between models seamlessly.
- Fast Integration: Simple configuration updates add new models to hundreds of products in minutes.
- Easier Pod Breakout: Facilitates separation by Radar/Model/Geo categories.

### 9. Problems We Encountered
**Theme:** Implementation challenges and solutions.
- Metadata Management: Manual keyword tag injection, unique WMS layer names required.
- Template Scope: Not everything should be templated - separate repositories for WMS configs and map files.
- File Path Management: Careful attention needed for layer tree structure.

### 10. Problems We Encountered (Continued)
**Theme:** Additional technical challenges faced.
- Detailed code examples and configuration issues.
- Metadata became important with manual keyword injection requirements.
- Template scope decisions and implicit vs explicit considerations.
