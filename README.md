# IBL UGM 2025 Presentations

This repository contains presentations given at the IBL User Group Meeting 2025, covering AI development practices and weather service infrastructure.

## ðŸŽ¯ Presentations

### [Tomorrow's Forecast: Accelerating Innovation with AI & Smarter Context Engineering](presentations/ai-presentation.md)
A presentation exploring how automation, AI agents, and context engineering can accelerate innovation in weather forecasting software. Highlights the importance of foundational automation and testing, demonstrates how AI can serve as a development partner, and shows how context engineering (and tools like MCP servers) enable smarter, faster workflows.

**Key Topics:**
- AI as a development partner
- Context engineering principles
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) overview
- Practical examples and live demonstrations

### [Weather Service Infrastructure - Many Things We Built](presentations/infra-presentation.md)
A comprehensive overview of the weather service infrastructure built by the team, covering performance optimization, templating solutions, monitoring systems, and database architecture. Demonstrates practical solutions to complex infrastructure challenges and lessons learned during implementation.

**Key Topics:**
- Shredder performance optimization
- WMS cloud architecture and templating
- Monitoring and visualization with Grafana, Prometheus, and Splunk
- Object Elastic Database (OED) and Online Weather systems
